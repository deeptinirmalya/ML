🚀Machine Learning – Learning Journey

This repository exists for one purpose: documenting my learning process in machine learning.
I’m not pretending to be an expert. I’m still in the early stages, and the code here will reflect that—experiments, mistakes, rough drafts, and gradual improvement.

What to Expect

Practice notebooks

Small ML models and experiments

Notes from courses, tutorials, and real-world testing

Updates as I understand more and rewrite earlier attempts

Why This Repo Exists

I want a place to track progress publicly, keep myself accountable, and see my skills evolve over time. If something looks messy or inefficient, that’s the point—I’m learning.

Status

Learning in progress.
Expect frequent changes and inconsistent quality. The goal is growth, not perfection.
